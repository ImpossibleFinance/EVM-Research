# EVM-Reserch

The analysis is a comparison of activity on EVM blockchains, including metrics such as daily transactions, active addresses, as well as average block creation time and daily block count.

There are 4 sectors, namely:

- On-chain Transactions metrics
- EVM Wallets metrics
- Block time and Blocks count
- Price of native tokens

The data is updated automatically every Monday:

```basg
0 0 * * 1 python3 upload_app.py >/dev/null 2>&1
```

All the libraries that were used are in the ***requirements.txt*** file
